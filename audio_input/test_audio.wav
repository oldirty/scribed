This is a dummy audio file for testing the Scribed file watcher functionality.

In a real implementation, this would be actual audio data in WAV, MP3, or FLAC format.
For now, we're just testing that the file watcher detects new files and creates
transcription placeholders.

File: test_audio.wav
Purpose: Testing batch transcription workflow
Expected output: A corresponding .txt file in the transcripts directory
